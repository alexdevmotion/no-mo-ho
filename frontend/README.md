# no-<s>ho</s>.js

A script which runs on the profile page of someone on Facebook.

It hooks on the post component and checks it for bad/offensive language in order to warn the user before sending it that they might be punished for writing that particular post.

After analysing the text, in case it's thought to be bad/offensive, the user will receive a list of alternative sentences with similar semantic meaning to replace the text. They may also modify the text furthermore after correction; it will still be analysed once more before sending and will need the explicit approval of the user in case it does not meet the requirements.

## Usage

- User must be logged into the Facebook web app
- Navigate to the profile page of someone whose timeline you can post on
- Copy the contents of the `dist/main.js` file (generated by the `npm run build` command) into the console and run it
- That's it. Try to write a post and see if it meets the requirements
